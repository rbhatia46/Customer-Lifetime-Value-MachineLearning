Computing Customer Lifetime value via Machine Learning approach

## 3 Questions to answer - 

1. Which customers have the highest spend probability in next 90 days ?

2. Which customers have recently purchased but unlikely to buy ? (look at customers have bought anything in last 90 days but have a lower purchase probability as per the model(less than 20%)) - revive the customer before they die

3. Which customers were predicted to purchase but didn't(missed opportunities) ? (people who were predicted to spend a certain amount and had a higher purchase probability in the next 90 days but actually spent 0 dollars) - get the marketing team to send these people targeted emails because these are missed opportunities that can boost the revenue quite significantly
